# Coursera_Capstone
Applied Data Science Capstone: 
A taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data:
- Location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. 
- How to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. 
- How to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. 
- Utilize Python and its pandas library to manipulate data. 
- Use the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and communicate the results and findings.

Week 1 - Introduction
- Learn about different location data providers and what location data is normally composed of
- submit a link to a new repository on your Github account dedicated to this course

Week 2 - Foursquare API
- Learn in details about Foursquare, the location data provider used in this course, and its API.

  - use your credentials to search for nearby venues of a specific type, 
  - explore a particular venue, and search for trending venues around a location.
  
Week 3 - Neighborhood Segmentation and Clustering
- Learn about k-means clustering, which is a form of unsupervised learning. 
- Use clustering and the Foursquare API to segment and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of New York. 
- Learn how to scrape website and parse HTML code using the Python package Beautifulsoup
- convert data into a pandas dataframe

Week 4 - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Part 1 of 2)
